Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests or opening an issue on Github. 

Generally speaking I will not be making any changes to this package unless I need them personally, but you are free to mention them in an issue. I may help, someone in the community may help, but ideally you create your own PR if you want changes made to the package.
